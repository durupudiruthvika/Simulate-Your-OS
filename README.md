## 📖 Overview

This Operating System Simulator is an educational tool built for simulating:

- CPU Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority, SRTF)
- Process Synchronization Problems (Producer-Consumer, Reader-Writer)
- Banker’s Algorithm for safe resource allocation
- Disk Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK)

It is aimed at helping students interactively understand how modern OS components work in real-time scenarios.
